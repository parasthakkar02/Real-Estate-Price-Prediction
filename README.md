# Real Estate Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts house price estimates for the Bangalore city based on various property features.

The model pipeline includes extensive data preprocessing, training using regression techniques, and validation to ensure predictive accuracy. The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data).

A Streamlit web application has been developed to provide a simple and interactive user interface for making predictions using the trained model.
